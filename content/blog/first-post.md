summary: Blog for Hyperspy

Hi everyone! I think there are some topics related to hyperspy which might deserve longer form 
posts.  For example, I've made a couple of posts as hyperspy issues such as this 
[post about large data](https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3107) which talk about large data.

There are lots of people doing lots of cool things using hyperspy but some of these things get lost in the
noise of the large number of issues and PRs.  I think it would be nice to have a place to highlight some of these
developments.
