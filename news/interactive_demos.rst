The demos section of the HyperSpy website has been replaced by a new
`interactive demos <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos/master>`_
page, making use of `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org>`_.

.. cut::

The demos are Jupyter notebooks and have been updated to be compatable with
the latest version of HyperSpy. It is not necessary to download or install
anything to give them a try, as all the code will be run remotely on
the `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org>`_ servers.

Everybody is encouraged to contribute to the demos by making a
`pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_
to the `hyperspy-demos github repository <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos>`_
or by email to the `hyperspy users mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/hyperspy-users>`_.
