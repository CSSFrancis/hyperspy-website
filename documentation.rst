Follow `this link <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos/master>`_ (or click the button above)
to launch a remote instance of HyperSpy. After a short wait, you will be presented with a folder of
demonstration notebooks with the extension ``.ipynb``. Click on one of these files to launch that notebook
on the `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org>`_ servers, which will allow you to try HyperSpy's features
without installing anything on your system.
